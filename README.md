# ðŸ“‹ Instagram Reach Analysis
If a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in the long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in.

## Problem Statement
The problem addressed in this project revolves around understanding and optimizing the reach of Instagram posts. As Instagram continually evolves and its algorithm changes, content creators face challenges in maintaining and maximizing their reach. The project seeks to provide insights into the factors influencing post reach and develop a predictive model to assist content creators in adapting their strategies for long-term success.

## Assumptions
1. The dataset collected from the Instagram account is representative of a diverse range of posts and user interactions.
2. Manual data collection is a reliable method due to limitations in the effectiveness of available APIs.
3. The relationships observed between various metrics and post reach generalize to a broader context beyond the specific Instagram account analyzed.

## Research Questions
1. What are the key factors influencing the reach of Instagram posts, and how do they interact with each other?
2. How does the Instagram algorithm impact post reach, and what insights can be derived from the distribution of impressions from different sources?
3. What is the correlation between user engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, saves) and the overall reach of posts?
4. Can a machine learning model accurately predict the reach of an Instagram post based on specific metrics?

## Hypotheses
1. The number of likes and saves will have a positive correlation with the overall reach of Instagram posts.
2. Posts receiving a higher number of shares will exhibit increased reach, but the impact of shares on reach will be less significant compared to likes.
3. The distribution of impressions from home, hashtags, and the explore section will vary, influencing the overall reach of posts.
4. A machine learning model, trained on user engagement metrics, can accurately predict the reach of Instagram posts, contributing to strategic content planning.

## My Analysis
Please browse my jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/charmieboo/Instagram-Reach-Analysis/blob/main/Instagram%20Reach%20Analysis.ipynb).

## My Recommendations
1. Prioritise user engagement by creating engaging content to boost likes and saves, correlating strongly with increased post reach.
2. Use strategic Hashtags to categorize content and broaden audience reach.
3. Continuously refine the machine learning model for predicting post reach, adapting to evolving Instagram algorithms and user behavior.
